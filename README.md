- 👋 Hi, I’m @MichelLDZ
- 🌱 I'm currently a student in engineering school at Ecole Centrale de Nantes where I am specialized in applied mathematics. During my specialization, I took courses
in statistics, probability theory and Machine Learning. At the moment, I'm in gap year and this is the oppurtunity for me to acquire professional experience and to gain
knowledge in the field of Data Science.
- 👀 Indeed, Data Science is what interests me the most and I would like to work on issues related to the ecological transition and renewable energy through it.
- 💞️ Therefore, I'm looking to collaborate on thuch projets.
- 📫 How to reach me ? You can reach me by mail : ldzmichel@gmail.com. It would be a pleasure to work with you 😉.
